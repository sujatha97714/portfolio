            <p> I'm a grad student studying Computer Engineering at ASU, set to graduate in May 2024. What really gets me excited is full stack web development and I love creating websites that are not only super dynamic and high-performing but also really user-friendly. My specialty? Building digital solutions that grow and adapt with the times, all while making sure users have an awesome experience. </p>
